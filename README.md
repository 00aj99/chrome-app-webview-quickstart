# Chrome WebView quickstart

While continuing my research about how to make a cross-platform desktop application based on ViStriker website, using a WebView and just connecting to the site without rewrite the application from scratch, I found this lightweight alternative: Google packaged Apps.

From: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps ,

"Chrome Apps let you use HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an experience comparable to a native application."

Let's give a try!

## Notice
This is a temporary solution. As provided in the link above, Chrome packaged apps will be discontinued in the early 2018.
